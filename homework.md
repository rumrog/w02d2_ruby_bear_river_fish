# Bear, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bear, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

Use TDD! 

Write tests to prove your methods work as you would expect. For example - if a bear eats a fish - what changes would you expect to see in the bear and river?

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A fish should have a name
---
- A river should have a name e.g. "Amazon"
- A river should hold many fish
- A river should be able to supply a fish
---
- A bear should have a name e.g. "Yogi" and a type e.g. "Grizzly"
- A bear should start with an empty stomach ( an array? )
- A bear should be able to take a fish from the river to eat. Yum.

## Extension

- A bear should not add a fish to its stomach if the river has run out of fish
